# Market-Entry-Analysis-for-ABG-Motors
This project involves analyzing the market potential for car sales in India and Japan, specifically focusing on predicting the likelihood of a customer purchasing a car based on various demographic and financial features.
## Project Overview:
### Data Preparation:
#### Datasets: 
The analysis uses two datasets: one from India and one from Japan. The Indian dataset includes fields like current age, gender, annual income, and the date of the last car maintenance. The Japanese dataset includes similar fields with the addition of car age and a purchase indicator.
#### Data Cleaning:
 The datasets were cleaned by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables (such as gender), and ensuring consistency in data types.
Model Building:

#### Algorithms Used: 
Various classification models, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, were trained on the Japanese dataset to predict car purchases.
#### Model Evaluation: 
The models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine their effectiveness.
#### Hyperparameter Tuning:
The models were further optimized using techniques like cross-validation to improve their performance.
### Application to Indian Dataset:
#### Prediction: 
The best-performing model from the Japanese dataset was applied to the Indian dataset to predict the number of potential car buyers.
#### Sales Estimation:
The model's predictions were used to estimate whether the target of 12,000 car sales in India could be achieved.
#### Business Interpretation:
The results were analyzed in a business context to understand the implications of the model's predictions and to justify the decisions made during model building and evaluation.
#### Visualization:
#### Tools:
 Tableau was used to create visualizations that compare market trends between India and Japan.
### Visualizations:
#### Bar Charts: 
Compare the number of potential car buyers between Indian and Japanese markets.
#### Line Charts: 
Showed trends in customer age, income, and car age in relation to purchase likelihood.
#### Heatmaps:
 Visualized the concentration of potential car buyers by gender in both countries.
#### Pie Charts:
 Provided a breakdown of male vs. female potential buyers in both markets.
### Outcome:
This project not only identifies key factors influencing car purchases in different markets but also provides actionable insights that can guide marketing strategies and sales efforts. The use of advanced data analysis and machine learning models ensures that the predictions are robust and reliable, making this project valuable for business decision-making.
